        "In this lesson we learned how Convolutional Neural Networks work with color images and saw various techniques that we can use to <u>avoid overfitting</u> . The main key points of this lesson are:\n",
        "\n",
        "CNNs with RGB Images of Different Sizes:\n",
        "*   **Resizing:** When working with images of different sizes, you must resize all the images to the same size so that they can be fed into a CNN.\n",
        "*   **Color Images:** Computers interpret color images as 3D arrays.\n",
        "*   **RGB Image:** Color image composed of 3 color channels: Red, Green, and Blue.\n",
        "*   **Convolutions:** When working with RGB images we convolve each color channel with its own convolutional filter. Convolutions on each color channel are performed in the same way as with grayscale images, i.e. by performing element-wise multiplication of the convolutional filter (kernel) and a section of the input array. The result of each convolution is added up together with a bias value to get the convoluted output.\n",
        "*   **Max Pooling:** When working with RGB images we perform max pooling on each color channel using the same window size and stride. Max pooling on each color channel is performed in the same way as with grayscale images, i.e. by selecting the max value in each window.\n",
        "*   **Validation Set:** We use a validation set to check how the model is doing during the training phase. Validation sets can be used to perform Early Stopping to prevent overfitting and can also be used to help us compare different models and choose the best one.\n",
