        "A convolutional layers can be added to the neural network model using the Conv2D layer type in Keras. This layer is similar to the Dense layer, and has weights and biases that need to be tuned to the right values. The Conv2D layer also has kernels (filters) whose values need to be tuned as well. So, in a Conv2D layer the values inside the filter matrix are the variables that get tuned in order to produce the right output.\n",

        "*   **Kernel / filter:** A matrix which is smaller than the input, used to transform the input into chunks\n",
        "*   **Padding:** Adding pixels of some value, usually 0, around the input image\n",
        "Pooling The process of reducing the size of an image through downsampling.There are several types of pooling layers. For example, average pooling converts many values into a single value by taking the average. However, maxpooling is the most common.\n",
        "*   **Maxpooling:** A pooling process in which many values are converted into a single value by taking the maximum value from among them.\n",
